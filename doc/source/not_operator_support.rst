Templates Not Operator Support
==============================

Overview
--------

The Templates language supports the "or" and "and" operators at the moment.
Many scenarios can't be described by using only those two operators and thus
we would like to add support for "not" operator as well.


Template Structure
==================
The template is written in YAML language, with the following structure.
 ::

  metadata:
    name: <unique template identifier>
    description: <what this template does>
  definitions:
    entities:
        - entity: ...
        - entity: ...
    relationships:
        - relationship: ...
        - relationship: ...
  scenarios:
      - scenario:
          condition: <if statement true do the action>
          actions:
              - action: ...


All the sections are in use as described in the "vitrage-template-format.rst" file.
But in the condition section it will be possible to write the "not" operator in addition to the "and" and "or" operators.
The "not" operator can be used only before a relationship expression.


Condition Format
----------------
The condition which needs to be met will be phrased using the entities and
relationships previously defined. The condition details are described in the
"vitrage-template-format.rst" and the addition here is the new logical operator "not":

- "not" - indicates that the expression must not be satisfied in order for the
  condition to be met.

The following are examples of valid expressions, where X, Y and Z are
relationships:

- X
- X and Y
- X and Y and Z
- X and not Y
- X and not (Y or Z)
- X and not X


Supported Use Cases
===================

Use Case 1:
-----------

Use Case 3:
-----------

The Switch is attached to a Host that contains a Vm.
The Switch is also comprised to a Network which has a Port.
There is no edge between the Vm and the Port.

Unsupported Use Cases
=====================

Use Case 1:
-----------

There is a Host contains Vm, which has no edge ("connection") to a stack that has an alarm on it.
Difference: The difference here from the graphs above, is that here there are
two connected component subgraphs (the first is host contains vm, the second is alarm on stack),
and the current mechanism doesn't support such a use case of not operator between many connected component subgraphs.
In the subgraphs above, we had only one vertex which was not connected to the main connected component subgraph.
